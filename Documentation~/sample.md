This sample demonstrates how to use the Lobby and Relay packages to create a typical game lobby experience.
Players can host lobbies that other players can join using a public lobby list or lobby code,
and then connect with Relay to use Unity Transport ("UTP") for basic real-time communication between them.
Relay allows players to securely communicate with each other while maintaining connection anonymity.
