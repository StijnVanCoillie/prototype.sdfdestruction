# Requirements and compatibility

* **Requires Unity 2020.3.25f1 or higher**. 

## Render pipeline compatibility

* SDF Destruction on Mesh Data supports only **Legacy**. However, the method should be easy to convert.
 
* Support for **forward rendering** and **deferred rendering**.

* We are currently unable to test on the consoles, so please bear this in mind.

* **Universal RP** and **HDRP** support is on the roadmap.
