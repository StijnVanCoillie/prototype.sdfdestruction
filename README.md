# Signed Distance Field Destruction on Mesh Data
This project attempts to explore a new way of applying destruction in a non-destructive way using signed distance fields on mesh data.

See the research paper [To what extent can Signed Distance Fields benefit destruction on Mesh Data](https://researchgate.net) for more information.
