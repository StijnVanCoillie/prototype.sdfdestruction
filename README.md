# Signed Distance Field Destruction on Mesh Data
This project attempts to explore a new way of applying destruction in a non-destructive way using signed distance fields on mesh data.

See the research paper [To what extent can Signed Distance Fields benefit destruction on Mesh Data](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/361472186_To_what_extent_can_Signed_Distance_Fields_benefit_destruction_on_Mesh_Data) for more information.
